* IMPROVEMENTS:

** use place holders like %s intead of string format for security (sql injection)

** use CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS instead of just CREATE TABLE

** close cursors // cursor.close()

*---------------------------------------------------------------------*

* ERRORS:

** i used SELECT total_points INTO total_points FROM subjects WHERE subject_id = NEW.subject_id;
** to save total_points into variable total_points and get None all the time.
** it worked when i changed variable total_points into total.
** using different variable name fixed it.
** took me long time figure it out with try and error and prints.

** in total_ave() function when i used cursor.fetchone() i had error when
** calling the function twice imedietely.  the error was:
** mysql.connector.errors.InternalError: Unread result found
** i googled and found that the error occures when there is unread data from
** previous query. so i used fetchall() to read everything and it fixed the error.
